## About
The program uses a variety of image assets to stochastically rerender the 8 ball with a different answer after each click and its subsequent shake animation. The background and title designs employ a polychromatic animation, and the 8 ball itself has a breathing glow effect, all of which is carefully timed so as to not draw excess attention and to still achieve its visual effect. If the user remains idle, which in this case refers to the prolonged absense of 8 ball shakes, the 8 ball will begin to slowly rotate, until it is clicked again.
